# Facebook Authorising App for Social Sweethearts

## Explanation of Features

1. Used social-auth-app-django to implement facebook login. This module is helpful to extend the login to github, google and other oauth providers.
3. The access token provided by social-auth-app-django is long lived and is stored in the `User social auths` table under `extras` field
4. When user connects the facebook account, the pipeline function - `load_user_and_profile_pic` (app/pipeline.py) - to save the name, profile picture and profile url in AppFbUser table.
5. When user disconnects the app, the pipeline function - `disconnect_user` (app/pipeline.py) - makes user.is_active=false in the database and the user is logged out.

6. And then in `App Domains` put localhost if running locally else put your website domain.
 
## Notes

1. I didn't know whether the profile picture should be saved in the database and should be picked up from facebook graph api. So I implemented both the scenario. After logging in, you would see 2 profile images - the left one is from graph api and the right one is from saved media picture.

2. Run with DEBUG=False in production, to redirect AuthCanceled error (when user cancels the facebook app request) to the home page.

3. I could have used class based view to make it more easily extendable and reusable but the amount of http request to be implemented is too less so I used function based view.
